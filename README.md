- Hi, I'm Callum
- I have 3 years industry experience as an apprentice software engineer and am currently in 4th year of the GA Software Engineering course at the University of Glasgow
- My account consists of a mixture of personal projects and university tasks (most of which should be archived)
- The main projects I am working on are TypeScript based using React or NextJS and are deployed using vercel
-   MatchdayEscapes - a site to showcase football stadiums all around Europe with the intention of helping fans visit
-   TrainTimetable - shows a departure board with the next 10 departures from both Glasgow Central and Queen Street
-   Scrapbookify - scrapbook style spotify app which shows users listening habits in a scrapbook
- Alongside these I am also proficient in Java and Python and have a discord bot project from my 1st year of university allowing you to post tweets from servers
